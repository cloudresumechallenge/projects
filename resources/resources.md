### The Cloud Resume Challenge Book
The [definitive resource](/book) for crushing the challenge and getting hired in cloud. Includes four additional challenges - two on AWS, one on Kubernetes / Google Cloud, and one that touches all three cloud providers.

### The Cloud Resume Challenge Discord Server
This is the place to be if you are working on the challenge. Join ~4000 other cloud enthusiasts ranging from beginners to experienced mentors. Ask your challenge questions, get code review, view cloud job postings, or just chat about cloud and life. It's free and very chill. What more reason do you need? [Join us already](https://discord.gg/2PTwAth).

### The Cloud Resume Challenge Video Tutorials
Are you a visual learner? Lou Bichard, founder of [Open Up The Cloud](https://openupthe.cloud/) and tireless friend of the challenge, has put together [a comprehensive video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7vZe7qZFmE) walking through each step of the original challenge. His [associated GitHub repository](https://github.com/openupthecloud/cloud-resume-challenge) also curates a nice selection of blogs written by challenge champions.

### The Challenge in Spanish
Challenger Jesus Rodriguez generously gave his time to translate [the AWS challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/instructions_es/), as well as [some FAQ](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/faq_es/), into Spanish. If you'd like the Cloud Resume Challenge translated into another language, please feel free to submit a pull request or create an issue.

### The Cloud Guru Challenges
Created under my supervision back when I worked at A Cloud Guru, [these projects](https://acloudguru.com/blog/tag/cloudguruchallenge) are part of a larger attempt to extend the general challenge format, and the response has mostly been pretty good. I'd suggest starting with [the COVID-19 tracking project I created](https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/cloudguruchallenge-python-aws-etl). Note that each of these projects includes "extra credit" ideas for making it your own - take advantage of that, as most folks don't!
